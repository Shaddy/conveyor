Rust for Advanced Hypervisor Interactions
=========================================

Conveyor is a cutting-edge project crafted in the Rust programming language that serves as a bridge between the end-user and advanced hypervisor operations. Using a robust combination of sentry and memoryguard, both of which are abstractions over the renowned [DeepShield hypervisor](https://github.com/ramonroyo/deepshield), Conveyor unveils a new horizon of capabilities. This project demonstrates the potential and practicality of intercepting System Service Dispatch Tables (SSDT), detecting side-channel attacks, and much more.
